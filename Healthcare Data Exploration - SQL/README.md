# Data Exploration of Healthcare Dataset in MS SQL

This project explores hospital data to uncover actionable insights into patient demographics, emergency department (ED) usage, readmission patterns, and operational efficiency. By leveraging SQL-based analytics on a comprehensive healthcare dataset, we identify trends that support data-driven decision-making in clinical operations, staffing, care coordination, and health equity.

### Key Tasks Performed:
- **Data Cleaning and Quality Checks:** Ensured data integrity by verifying patient records, completeness of key fields, and consistency in data formats.
- **Demographic Analysis:** Explored how age, race, and gender impact healthcare utilization, identifying patterns such as high ED usage among seniors and disparities in outpatient care access for certain racial groups.
- **High-Utilizer Identification:** Pinpointed a small group of patients responsible for a significant portion of ED visits, highlighting opportunities for targeted care coordination.
- **Operational Efficiency Analysis:** Examined ED visit timings and length of stay to identify bottlenecks and inform staffing optimization.
- **Readmission and Discharge Analysis:** Investigated readmission rates and admission characteristics to identify diagnoses and patient groups that require enhanced post-discharge support.
  
This project demonstrates how data analytics can be leveraged to generate actionable insights for improving healthcare delivery.
