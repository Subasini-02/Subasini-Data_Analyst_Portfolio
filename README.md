# Welcome to my portfolio.
In these projects, I used SQL and Python to clean and explore real-world datasets, preparing them for deeper analysis and visualization. This involved handling missing or inconsistent data, standardizing formats, removing duplicates, and extracting key insights through aggregation and filtering techniques.

I applied SQL concepts such as joins, CTEs, window functions, and temporary tables, alongside Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to uncover patterns, trends, and meaningful relationships within the data.

These projects highlight my ability to work across both databases and programming environments to enable effective, data-driven decision-making.
