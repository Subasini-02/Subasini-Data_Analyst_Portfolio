# CGM Diabetes Data Analysis Using Python
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of the HUPA-UCM Diabetes Dataset using Python, focusing on Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) patients' continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data and associated lifestyle factors. The analysis combines descriptive insights with prescriptive recommendations to improve diabetes management strategies and identify high-risk patients requiring immediate intervention.

The dataset contains detailed information about 25 T1DM patients monitored over 14+ days, including continuous glucose readings via FreeStyle Libre 2 sensors, insulin administration records (basal rates and bolus doses), meal intake measured in carbohydrate grams, physical activity metrics (steps, calories burned), heart rate data, and comprehensive sleep assessments (quality, duration, disturbances) collected through Fitbit Ionic devices. This multi-modal data provides a holistic view of diabetes management, enabling researchers to understand complex relationships between lifestyle factors and glycemic control.

**Key Analysis Components:**

* **Descriptive Analytics:**
  * Patient demographic profiling (age, gender, race distribution)
  * Sleep pattern analysis and quality assessment across different age groups
  * Glucose level distribution classification (normal, hypoglycemic, hyperglycemic episodes)
  * Correlation analysis between sleep disturbances, carbohydrate intake, and glucose variability

* **Prescriptive Analytics:**
  * Risk stratification using logistic regression to identify hyperglycemia predictors
  * Insulin optimization through basal-bolus ratio analysis and mismatch identification
  * Sleep intervention prioritization scoring system for targeted therapy recommendations
  * High-risk patient flagging based on combined poor sleep quality and excessive carbohydrate intake

* **Clinical Insights Generation:**
  * Statistical testing (t-tests, Pearson correlations) to validate relationships
  * Patient-specific recommendations for sleep interventions and glucose monitoring
  * Identification of lifestyle and clinical predictors requiring immediate attention

**Key Findings:**
* Strong negative correlation between sleep disturbances and overall sleep quality
* Significant positive correlation between carbohydrate intake and glucose levels
* Multiple patients identified with suboptimal basal-bolus insulin ratios
* High-risk patient cohort successfully identified through combined sleep and dietary factors
* Priority scoring system developed to guide healthcare providers in intervention planning

This project not only provides actionable insights for individual patient care but also establishes a framework for population-level diabetes management strategies. The analysis supports evidence-based decision making in clinical settings and contributes to the growing body of research on personalized diabetes care through continuous monitoring technologies.
